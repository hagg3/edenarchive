## Eden Source Code

In 2018, Ari released the game's source code. It is available on GitHub alongside a few WIP projects that community members have started using the source code.

[Version 2.1.1 source code](https://github.com/BarrelDevelopment/EdenWorldBuilder/tree/2.1.1 )

[Version 2.1 source code](https://github.com/ryanjkontos/EdenWorldBuilder)

The version 2.1 link contains the version of the source code that was published by Ari in 2018. It is the latest unmodified version of the source code that is publicly available. The 2.2.X updates from 2021 onwards with the increased height limit have not yet had any source code publications.

The version 2.1.1 link contains a repo modified by Barrel for compatibility with Xcode 16. The world download function has been modified so that it points to the current server as opposed to the legacy server. The hidden fly mode is activated by default, but can be deactiviated easily by following instructions in the README.

## Eden World Manipulator
Eden World Manipulator is a program developed and published by Jeremy. It was written from the source code provided from the first version of Vuenctools. Full article coming soon. There is a wiki article, which is currently outdated. You can access that [here](https://edenworldbuilder.fandom.com/wiki/Eden_World_Manipulator).

[Eden World Manipulator v3.0](https://www.mediafire.com/file/zsjpmdwnm1plao4/Eden_World_Manipulator_3.0.exe/file)

[Eden World Manipulator v2.0 (legacy)](http://www.mediafire.com/file/z4gtreigj46getg/Eden_World_Maniputor.exe/file)

[v2.0 source code](https://github.com/jldeiro/EdenWorldManipulator2.0)

The latest version (3.0)  of Eden World Manipulator allows you to download/upload worlds from both the current and legacy shared world servers. When loaded, you are able to generate maps and make edits to your world, such as mass changing block type/colour, generating trees and adding water. 

Note: there is a bug in version 3.0 where generating trees will result in them missing stumps/log blocks.

## Reverse-Engineering 

Robert Munafo has written documentation on the game's file format, which has been useful for developing a mapping utility and manipulator software:

[Munafo's command-line mapping program](https://www.mrob.com/pub/vidgames/la-map.c.txt)
