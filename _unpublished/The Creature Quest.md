'The Creature Quest' is a series of adventure map themed worlds that first appeared in 2015. As of August 2025, there are 31 versions available to download from the shared worlds list, with the most recent being published in June 2025.

The creator of the worlds recommends playing with health turned on, and not breaking any blocks unless you are stuck. The burn/fire tool is only supposed to be used on switches, which are the wooden spiky things. This is a clever mechanic that allows doors and passageways to be 'opened', as the switches connect to said doors via a hidden flammable trail that will eventually burn the door or blockage preventing players from initially moving through that passageway.

Parts 1-11 are the first worlds released by the creator. Parts 12-22 are set in a mine/underground environment. Parts 23-31 are set in a snow environment. Parts 1-29 look better visually when played in the slightly older 2.1 version of the game (2015-2021) as the newer 2.2.x versions (2021-) change the way that coloured lighting works. All worlds in the series are however still playable on any version of the game from 2.1 onwards.
