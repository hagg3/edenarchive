## Home
This website is a **work-in-progress preservation and curation project** for *Eden World Builder*.

The core purpose of the project is to maintain a **curated catalogue of high-quality Eden world files**, rather than a raw or complete bulk archive. Over the lifetime of the game, tens of thousands of worlds were uploaded—many of which are spam uploads, broken test files, or minor revisions of existing catalogue worlds. Attempting to archive everything would significantly reduce the usefulness of the collection.

Instead, this site focuses on:

- Worlds that appeared on **official or in-game featured lists** throughout Eden’s history  
- **Notable community creations** and “hidden gems” discovered through the later shared-worlds upload and search systems  
- Select **historically or technically significant versions** of worlds, where older iterations meaningfully demonstrate how a world evolved over time  

Older versions are only archived where they add value; this is not intended to be a version-complete mirror of the Eden servers.

There already exists a fan-maintained project at (https://eden.anmon.org/) that aims to mass archive and preserve worlds. It even includes a feature that allows you to quickly archive a world from the game servers, provided that you know the world ID.

## Improved Discoverability

One of the main motivations for this project is the **poor usability of Eden’s in-game world search**, particularly in later years when spam uploads overwhelmed meaningful content.

To address this, all archived worlds are organized using a **manual tagging system**. Tags allow worlds to be browsed and filtered by type and theme. For example:

- City builds  
- Parkour / challenge maps  
- Castles and historical builds  
- Experimental or technical worlds  

This makes it significantly easier to discover worlds by interest rather than by filename, author, or upload date alone.

## Project Status Notes

- This site is **actively under development**  
- Some metadata (such as file size for worlds uploaded using the newer parser) may be inaccurate and will be corrected or removed in future updates  

Expect gradual improvements rather than rapid iteration.
