# Santa Ines

## Description

Santa Ines is a medium sized city world built in the centre of the new Normal World. 

Notable features include:
- Downtown area with commercial and residential buildings.
- Old Town district.
- International Airport complete with runway and terminal.
- Mixture of architecture styles.
- Realistically scaled road infrastructure.

Due to its origins as a community world, it features contributions from several builders.

## History

This world was first published on 2nd Febuary 2018 as DSCW123, which stood for Discord Server Community World. It was initially created by Sam H as a collaboration world for the Discord community. Due to difficulties arranging times for community members to build, and the fact that Santiago H had put most work in to it, it later became his own world. Other community members did make contributions, including an Old Town district built by Dblcut3 and a Downtown area by Andy500.

The vast majority of the building after the first few versions was done by Santiago and it eventually developed in to a city build named Santa Ines. It was named Santa Ines by Santiago and Sam until November 2019, after which point Santiago was the only builder working on it.
