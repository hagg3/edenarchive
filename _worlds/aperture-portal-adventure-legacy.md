## Aperture Portal Adventure Legacy

There may be an article available for this world. Check back soon!

This is a legacy version of the world available for players who cannot or choose not to upgrade from Eden 2.1. The only difference other than file size between both versions is that the legacy version uses the original lighting configuration whereas the [standard version]({{ site.baseurl }}/worlds/aperture-portal-adventure) has had placement of lamp blocks adjusted to work better with the new behaviour of lamps in 2.2-.
