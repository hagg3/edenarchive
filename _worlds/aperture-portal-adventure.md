## Aperture Portal Adventure

There may be an article available for this world. Check back soon!

There is a [legacy version]({{ site.baseurl }}/worlds/aperture-portal-adventure-legacy) of the world available for players who cannot or choose not to upgrade from Eden 2.1. The only difference other than file size between both versions is that the legacy version uses the original lighting configuration whereas this one has had placement of lamp blocks adjusted to work better with the new behaviour of lamps in 2.2-.
